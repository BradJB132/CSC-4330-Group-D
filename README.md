The update folder contains the source code for a separate website used to update and debug the project website during testing, it is not used in the actual project source code but was included to show how we tested our website.

Temporary Website Link: breadnbutter132.net:30207
(will be open until grading is completed)

To open the website as a local server:
Pull the repository
run node server.js
go to localhost:30207

Because of the database we used and their security measures, THE DATABASE WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOUR IP ADDRESS IS WHITELISTED IN THE DATABASE!!!
Please contact bbaudi2@lsu.edu if you want to host this on your local machine.
